# Open questions

Behaviour the implementation needs but no spec covers yet. Analysts answer
a question with a spec (see [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md)) and remove it here.
Each entry says where the question came from and what the code does until
it is answered.

## Trigger strings (`war3map.wts`)

Answered by SPEC-0003; its own open questions are listed there. Choices
the implementation made where the spec is silent:

- **Malformed first definition.** If a number first appears as a header
  without a body and later with a braced body, which text is shown? Until
  answered: the empty text of the first, malformed definition.
- **Indented opening brace.** A `{` after spaces or tabs opens the body.
- **Missing closing brace.** A body that reaches the end of the file keeps
  the text read so far.
- **Comments before the brace.** Comment lines between the header and the
  `{` are skipped, as editor-saved maps put one there; a non-comment line
  instead of the `{` makes the entry empty.

## Map info (`war3map.w3i`)

The layout is confirmed by parsing every shipped map to its last byte; the
meaning of these fields comes from community notes only:

- order of the four camera bound corners;
- channel order of the fog and water colours;
- meaning of the flag bits and of the player ally priority masks.

## Terrain (`war3map.w3e`)

Layout and grid size are confirmed against every shipped map (the grid is
the playable area plus the camera bound margins, and the tileset matches
`war3map.w3i`). The meaning of these fields comes from community notes only:

- how ground height and water level map to world height;
- the point flag bits (ramp, blight, water, boundary) and bit 14 of the
  water field;
- what `texture_details` selects, and how layer height and cliff texture
  produce cliffs.

## Doodads (`war3map.doo`)

Every doodad of every shipped map lies on its terrain, which confirms the
position fields. Not yet confirmed:

- the meaning of the flags byte and of `life_percent` for doodads that are
  not destructible;
- what the `z` field of special doodads means;
- how `item_table` and `dropped_item_sets` interact when both are set.

## Object modifications (`war3map.w3u` and related files)

All object files of the shipped maps parse to their last byte, every
modified field exists in the game's metadata tables, and each metadata type
is always stored as the same value type. Not yet confirmed:

- **End marker.** Current editors write 0 or the object's code after each
  value; files of format version 1 also hold codes of unrelated objects
  there. Does the game read this field at all?
- **Versions 1 and 2** have the same layout in the shipped maps. Does the
  game treat them differently?
- **Data column** of ability, doodad and upgrade fields: confirm that 1
  means `DataA` and how 0 is used.
- **Precedence** when the original table changes a field that the map's
  SLK or INI files also set, and how levels beyond an object's level count
  are handled.

## Placed units (`war3mapUnits.doo`)

All unit files of the shipped maps parse to their last byte, and every
player of `war3map.w3i` has its start location placed at the coordinates
given there. Not yet confirmed:

- **Random kind.** After the abilities comes a kind: 0, 1 or 2 with data,
  or another value with no data. Reign of Chaos maps use -1 for units that
  are not random; `FrozenThrone/(4)Roundabout.w3x` has 0x281 on a gold mine.
  How does the game treat values other than 0, 1 and 2?
- the meaning of the flags byte and of the two bytes after the owner;
- the 24-bit level and the item class byte of the level form, and the
  default gold of a mine when the field is 0;
- whether dropped item sets in Reign of Chaos maps behave like those of
  Frozen Throne maps, which also have an item table index.

## Regions, cameras and sounds (`war3map.w3r`, `w3c`, `w3s`)

All files of the shipped maps parse to their last byte, every region's
rectangle is ordered, every region ends with byte 0xFF, and every ambient
sound of a region names a sound of the same map. Not yet confirmed:

- the float after a camera's far clipping distance;
- the sound fields without a documented meaning (`unknown_a` to
  `unknown_h`) and the meaning of the sound flag bits.

## JASS syntax (`ow3-jass`)

Precedence, literals and escapes are answered by SPEC-0005. Still open:

- **Reserved words.** The parser reserves the six built-in type names
  (`integer`, `real`, `boolean`, `string`, `handle`, `code`) as well as the
  keywords; SPEC-0001 confirms this only for `code` as a parameter name.
- **Unary `+`.** SPEC-0005 lists `not` and unary `-`; the parser also
  accepts unary `+`. Does the game?
- **Raw codes of five or more characters.** SPEC-0005 rejects 2 and 3
  characters; the parser rejects every length other than 1 and 4.
- **Lines.** Are string literals across line breaks accepted, and is a
  carriage return alone a line break?
- **Names.** May names start or end with an underscore?

## JASS names and types (`ow3-jass::check`)

`common.j` with `Blizzard.j`, all shipped map scripts and all but seven AI
scripts pass the checker. Two map test scripts for SPEC-0001 fail with the
native name clash that spec describes. Not yet confirmed:

- **Outdated AI scripts.** `Scripts\demo.ai`, `h04_orange.ai` and the five
  `orc03*.ai` call `common.ai` functions with older signatures (for example
  `CampaignAI` with one argument, while `common.ai` takes `integer farms,
  code heroes`) or use undeclared names. Does the game ever compile them,
  and against which `common.ai`?
- **`null` as an integer.** `(6)BomberCommand.w3x` returns `null` from an
  integer function and the map is shipped, so the checker accepts `null`
  where an integer is expected. Is that true everywhere (arguments,
  assignments, `real`, `boolean`), and what value results?
- **Repeated locals.** The same map declares `local real rHeight` twice in
  one function. The checker accepts a repeated local of the same type. Is
  a different type accepted, and can a local repeat a parameter's name?
- **Order of declarations.** The checker requires a function to be
  declared above the code that calls it or refers to it with `function`,
  and a global above the global initialiser that uses it.
- **Shared names.** May a global share its name with a function, or a local
  with a global (the checker allows both)?
- **Comparisons.** The checker allows `==` and `!=` between any two handle
  types and between `null` and handle, string or code values.
- **Code values.** Can `function F` refer to a native, or to a function
  that takes parameters?
