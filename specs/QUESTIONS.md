# Open questions

Behaviour the implementation needs but no spec covers yet. Analysts answer
a question with a spec (see [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md)) and remove it here.
Each entry says where the question came from and what the code does until
it is answered.

## Trigger strings (`war3map.wts`)

- **Header without a body.** `(1)TheDeathSheep.w3m` has `STRING 681`
  followed by a bare `#VALUE!` line instead of `{ ... }`. What does the game
  show for `TRIGSTR_681`, and does the bare line affect the entries after it?
  Until answered: the entry is undefined and parsing resumes at the next
  `STRING` header.
- **Repeated numbers.** If a number appears twice, which text does the game
  use? Until answered: the later one.
- **Unresolved references.** What does the game show for a `TRIGSTR_<n>`
  whose number is not defined? Until answered: the caller gets no text.

## Map info (`war3map.w3i`)

The layout is confirmed by parsing every shipped map to its last byte; the
meaning of these fields comes from community notes only:

- order of the four camera bound corners;
- channel order of the fog and water colours;
- meaning of the flag bits and of the player ally priority masks.

## Terrain (`war3map.w3e`)

Layout and grid size are confirmed against every shipped map (the grid is
the playable area plus the camera bound margins, and the tileset matches
`war3map.w3i`). The meaning of these fields comes from community notes only:

- how ground height and water level map to world height;
- the point flag bits (ramp, blight, water, boundary) and bit 14 of the
  water field;
- what `texture_details` selects, and how layer height and cliff texture
  produce cliffs.

## Doodads (`war3map.doo`)

Every doodad of every shipped map lies on its terrain, which confirms the
position fields. Not yet confirmed:

- the meaning of the flags byte and of `life_percent` for doodads that are
  not destructible;
- what the `z` field of special doodads means;
- how `item_table` and `dropped_item_sets` interact when both are set.

## Object modifications (`war3map.w3u` and related files)

All object files of the shipped maps parse to their last byte, every
modified field exists in the game's metadata tables, and each metadata type
is always stored as the same value type. Not yet confirmed:

- **End marker.** Current editors write 0 or the object's code after each
  value; files of format version 1 also hold codes of unrelated objects
  there. Does the game read this field at all?
- **Versions 1 and 2** have the same layout in the shipped maps. Does the
  game treat them differently?
- **Data column** of ability, doodad and upgrade fields: confirm that 1
  means `DataA` and how 0 is used.
- **Precedence** when the original table changes a field that the map's
  SLK or INI files also set, and how levels beyond an object's level count
  are handled.
